# Project Name
Our Project is based on Flutter. Our objective is to build a QR Code scanner and QR Codecreator app which can eliminate the need of visitor's registry in shops. Our project is certainly not in a final phase but we have started from learning the basics of flutter and firebase. So our app has a certain framework on accommodating both user and merchant information. We are complete beginners in case of programming and frontend development too but we have certainly worked hard to get this going and made it into a level where we are proud of what we have created. The app might look basic but it incoporates the need and the aim of the project. We are working on redesigning our project into a complete structure.
